                  Feedback reviews provided by Companies while completing an
                  Order are an essential part of Instollar LLC's rating system.
                  Reviews demonstrate the Company's overall experience with the
                  Freelancers and their service. Companies are encouraged to
                  communicate to the Installer any concerns experienced during
                  their active order regarding the service provided by the
                  Installer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Leaving a Company's feedback is a basic prerogative of a
                  Company. Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are
                  clear violations of our Terms of Service and/or our Community
                  Standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback
                  reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively
                  through the Instollar LLC platform from users within our
                  Community. Purchases arranged, determined to artificially
                  enhance Installer ratings, or to abuse the Instollar LLC
                  platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result
                  in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Feedback comments given by Companies are publicly displayed on

                  Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a
                  Company in a delivery message. Work Samples are added to a
                  Freelancer’s Live Portfolio on their page if the Company
                  chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public

                  Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the
                  Company has three days to respond. If no response is provided
                  within the response period, the Order will be considered

                <li>
                  Users are allowed to leave reviews on Orders up to 10 days

                  added to an Order after 10 days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Freelancers may not solicit the removal of feedback reviews
                  from their Companies through mutual cancellations.

                  Once the Company submits his/her review, the Installer will
                  receive a notification and will also have the opportunity to
                  leave a review about working with the Company. Please Note: At
